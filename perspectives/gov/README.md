# South Korean Government's Perspective on This case

South Korean Government is very strict about this, If you want to service in Korea, follow the law of South Korea.  
(a.k.a. implement Shutdown Act and declare business in South Korea or die)  
  
[Update: Currently Ministry of Gender Equality and Family haven't changed any opinion about it. (Yes, I know. This is "Microsoft's Incompliance with "Shutdown Act"" from the VERY BEGINNING. You don't need to re-explain that!)](https://twitter.com/mogef/status/1410970800899825667?s=21)

Therefore, Microsoft, who can't implement Shutdown Act (since it is PC-Xbox-Android Crossplay based), due to its very service nature,  
Should implement Shutdown Act according to South Korean Government which gives Microsoft a headache.

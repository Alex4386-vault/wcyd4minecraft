# What can you do for Minecraft
<p align="right"><sup>Maintained by <a href="https://github.com/Alex4386">Alex4386</a></sup></p>

**TL;DR**: Minecraft have started migration to Xbox Account (which requires Xbox Profile),  
Which is **unavailable** for anyone **under age of 19** on **all hours** due Microsoft's decision on teenager/childrens.

## For who doesn't know the context
South Korea is notoriously known for Video game sanctions in entire markets. and considers Video game as a entirely as a explicit harm for teenagers/childrens. [Reference<sup>1</sup>](https://edition.cnn.com/2011/11/22/world/asia/south-korea-gaming/index.html)  

The law that passed on 2011 is called *"Game Play-time selection act"* (a.k.a. **"Shutdown Act"**) presented by [Ministry of Gender Equality and Family](https://mogef.go.kr), requiring all video game service provider **to implement a South Korean National ID Verification System in order to play a video game, and shutdown the video game service entirely for him/her/its game session from 10PM to 8AM next day if he/she/it is less than 15** (or 19 depends on his/her/its parent's configuration) **years old.**  

But this was a hassle for Console market, (shutting down when it is 10PM-8AM) Therefore Microsoft Korea implemented its all of its service as 18+.  
Requiring **South Korean National ID Verification with age over 18** if you want to play any Xbox Live game.  

Since the Minecraft's migration to Microsoft Account **REQUIRES** Xbox Profile, which **CAN NOT** be created without Xbox Account, anyone under 18+ right at the moment has migrated to Microsoft Account can not **use the Minecraft Launcher** and **Log in** to his Minecraft account.  

Have you thought about [Deleting son's minecraft world](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/gap4oq/aita_for_deleting_my_sons_minecraft_world/) is an asshole?  
Well, south korean government literally deleted the **ENTIRE GAME**.  
  
Thanks, [Ministry of Gender Equality and Family](https://mogef.go.kr). <sub>(SLOW CLAP)</sub>

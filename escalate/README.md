### Share the words in community
In the [2011한마659 Verdict](../legal/2011한마659.md), as you can see, this law was enacted with totalitarianism and suppressing of freedom in the core.  

Also, verdict statement literally tells  `public good arising from limiting teenager's access is much more than providing freedom for parents to allow their childrens to play online games.`.  

which clearly says Freedom of the individual was suppressed for public good. (even destroying the individual's dream, being a professional gamer). This is a pure definition of totalitarianism and also, nazism and more-likely seen on other-side of the Korea.

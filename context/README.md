# Context of current situtation

South Korea is notoriously known for Video game sanctions in entire markets. and considers Video game as a entirely as a explicit harm for teenagers/childrens. [Reference<sup>1</sup>](https://edition.cnn.com/2011/11/22/world/asia/south-korea-gaming/index.html)  

The law that passed on 2011 is called *"Teenager Protection Act* and its successor, *"Game Play-time selection act"* (a.k.a. both in general called: **"Shutdown Act"**) presented by [Ministry of Gender Equality and Family](https://mogef.go.kr), requiring all video game service provider **to implement a South Korean National ID Verification System in order to play a video game, and shutdown the video game service entirely for him/her/its game session from specified time if he/she/it is less than 15** (or 19 depends on his/her/its parent's configuration) **years old.**  

If you think this is a human rights violation, South Korean government thinks that's a no. See [2011한마659 Case](../legal/2011한마659.md)

But this was a hassle for Console market, (shutting down when it is 10PM-8AM or shutting down for specified time) Therefore Microsoft Korea implemented its all of its service as 18+.  
Requiring **South Korean National ID Verification with age over 18** if you want to play any Xbox Live game.  

Since the Minecraft's migration to Microsoft Account **REQUIRES** Xbox Profile, which **CAN NOT** be created without Xbox Account, anyone under 18+ right at the moment has migrated to Microsoft Account can not **use the Minecraft Launcher** and **Log in** to his Minecraft account.  

Currently, South Korean Minecraft players (especially, Java Edition Players. which previously did not require Xbox Live account) is outraging as this is equivalent of [Deleting son's minecraft world](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/gap4oq/aita_for_deleting_my_sons_minecraft_world/) but in larger scale.

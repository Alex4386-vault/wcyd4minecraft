This Repository tries to **summarize the drama** rising up due to **[recent Mojang account migration to Microsoft Account](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4403183382541-How-to-Migrate-Your-Mojang-Account-to-a-Microsoft-Account-No-Images-)** and **its outcome causing anyone under 18 unable to access their minecraft account** after the migration until they become 18+.  

**TL;DR**: Minecraft have started migration to Xbox Account (which requires Xbox Profile),

As a grown-up adult that learned Java programming via Minecraft (and still developing Minecraft Java Edition Plugins to current day), I don't want to let this happen.
